Overhall of GitHub repo!!
Made an images repository on GitHub (remotely) by using a placeholder.txt
Added in a file from my personal computer (didn't know how to do this from my VM without a link to said image
Pulled those changes to my local system

Generally learned more CLI commands including stat command
Used that to get info on an old entry_one.md file
Used that info to rename the file when I moved it to my new logs folder

I had to do multiple git pushes to sync these changes!
Edited README.md in nano, but I needed the preview feature while practicing with markdown

git add README.me; commited it; and pushed to main

THEN

git commit -a; this deleted my entry_one file, and placeholder.txt in Image directory

Still could not see the renamed entry_one file in logs repository 
git add logs; commit and pushed to origin main

All seemed to be caught up and synched!

Edited README in GitHub remotely for ease with markdown.
Commited changes to links, formatting of timeline list, and added photo + quote
