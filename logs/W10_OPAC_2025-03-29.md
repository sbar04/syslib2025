# Week 10: Bare Bones OPAC

![It's All Coming Together!](../Images/kronk.jpg)

This week I created a very very basic Online Public Access Catalog, building on the LAMP technologies of the prior weeks and the data in the `opacdb` database. 

It's no ILS, but it's a start!

## HTML Page and PHP Search Page
First up is creating the HTML page, <b>mylibrary.html</b>, that will display in a browser and allow users to search the `opacdb` database. 

I went to `/var/www/html` to put this in the Apache document root HTML directory and created the mylibrary.html file:

```
sudo nano mylibrary.hmtl
```

I typed in the script to create a basic HTML page explaining the OPAC and providing a form element to search the database: 
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>MySQL Server Example</title>
    </head>
<body>

    <h1>A Basic OPAC</h1>

    <p>In the form below, <b>optionally</b> enter text in the search field.
    Your search query will search by author, title, or publisher.
    Capitalization is not necessary.
    It's okay to enter partial information, like part of an author's, title's, or publisher's name.</p>

    <p>You can leave the search field empty and only enter dates.
    Regardless, both start and end dates are required for all searches.
    You can use the date fields to limit results, too.
    I added some extra records, which you can view to know what you can query:</p>

    <p><a href="opac.php">OPAC</a></p>

    <p>This is very much a toy, stripped down
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_public_access_catalog">OPAC</a>.
    The records are basic.
    Not only do they not conform to <a href="https://www.loc.gov/marc/">MARC</a>,
    they don't even conform to something as simple as <a href="https://www.dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</a>.

    <p>I also don't provide options to select different fields, like author, title, or publisher fields.
    Instead the search field below searches all the fields (author, title, publisher) in our <b>books</b> table.</p>

    <p>The key idea is to get a sense of how an OPAC works, though.</p>

    <h2>My Basic Library OPAC</h2>

    <form method="post" action="search.php">
        <label for="search">Search Terms (optional):</label>
        <input type="text" name="search" id="search">
        
        <br>
        
        <label for="start_date">Start Date:</label>
        <input type="date" name="start_date" id="start_date" required>
        
        <br>
        
        <label for="end_date">End Date:</label>
        <input type="date" name="end_date" id="end_date" required>
        
        <br>
        
        <input type="submit" value="Search">
    </form>

</body>
</html>
```
This html file references a file called <b>search.php</b>, which I create below in the same `/var/www/html` directory:
```
sudo nano search.php.
```
And entered the following PHP script:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Search Results</title>
<style>
    table {
        border-collapse: collapse;
        width: 100%;
    }
    th, td {
        border: 1px solid black;
        padding: 8px;
        text-align: left;
    }
</style>
</head>
<body>

    <h1>Search Results</h1>

    <?php
    // Load MySQL credentials
    require_once '/var/www/login.php';

    // Enable MySQL error reporting
    mysqli_report(MYSQLI_REPORT_ERROR | MYSQLI_REPORT_STRICT);

    // Establish connection
    $conn = new mysqli($db_hostname, $db_username, $db_password, $db_database);
    if ($conn->connect_error) {
        die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
    }

    if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
        $search = trim($_POST['search']);
        $start_date = $_POST['start_date'];
        $end_date = $_POST['end_date'];

        // Prepared statement to prevent SQL injection
        $stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT * FROM books 
                                WHERE (author LIKE ? OR title LIKE ? OR publisher LIKE ?) 
                                AND copyright BETWEEN ? AND ?");

        // Use wildcard search
        $search_param = "%$search%";
        $stmt->bind_param("sssss", $search_param, $search_param, $search_param, $start_date, $end_date);
        $stmt->execute();
        $result = $stmt->get_result();

        if ($result->num_rows > 0) {
            echo "<table>";
            echo "<tr><th>ID</th><th>Author</th><th>Title</th><th>Publisher</th><th>Copyright</th></tr>";

            while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
                echo "<tr>";
                echo "<td>" . htmlspecialchars($row["id"]) . "</td>";
                echo "<td>" . htmlspecialchars($row["author"]) . "</td>";
                echo "<td>" . htmlspecialchars($row["title"]) . "</td>";
                echo "<td>" . htmlspecialchars($row["publisher"]) . "</td>";
                echo "<td>" . htmlspecialchars($row["copyright"]) . "</td>";
                echo "</tr>";
            }

            echo "</table>";
        } else {
            echo "<p>No results found.</p>";
        }

        $stmt->close();
    }

    $conn->close();
    ?>

    <p><a href="mylibrary.html">Return to search page</a></p>

</body>
</html>
```
>This creates an HTML document. The header includes metadata about the document. There is a style section with basic CSS for formatting the results. 

>The PHP elements start with the opening PHP tag `<?php`, and each includes `//` comments that help explain each section.

>It refers to the `login.php` file made in Week 8.
```
    require_once '/var/www/login.php';
```
>It establishes a connection with `MySQL`, and uses the `POST` request method which is the same as the form method in the mylibrary.html file. 

>There is a statement to prevent SQL injection where you can see the SQL command to:
```
SELECT * from books
WHERE (author LIKE ?  or title LIKE ? or publisher LIKE ?
AND copyright BETWEEN ? and ?");
```

>The script echos out results in a table format. 

This HTML form and PHP script are connected, and allow us to see the search the `books` table in the `opacdb` via my external IP address. 

```
externalIP/mylibrary.html
```

## Modifications
Adding and deleting records from the `books` table will be reflected in the website's search thanks to the PHP script.

I logged in to the MySQL server as `opacuser` to add records:
```
mysql -u opacuser -p
```
And inserted values (of books I've recently read!) using the `INSERT` command covered in Weeks 8 and 9. 

# Takeaways
This week's content made it much easier to see how an OPAC functions! Messing with the `books` table and seeing those changes reflected immediately due to the PHP script made the relationship between all of the technologies we've been putting together click for me.
