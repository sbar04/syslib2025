# Week 7: Installing PHP

There are two kinds of programming languages for web development: client side and server side. Graphical browsers came with engines that execute client side programming languages like Javascript.

## Installing PHP
PHP is __server side__, so we need to install and configure the relevant modules to work with Apache2 (and next week MySQL). 

Updated my machine, then used the following commands:
```
sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php
```
This installed the php and the libapache2-mod-php packages. The second one creates a connection between PHP and Apache2.
```
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```
This restarts Apache2.

Confirmed the version with `php -v`. 

Finally, checked Apache2's status in case of any errors:
`systemctl status apache2`, but it should be loaded and active.

## Check Install
To check that PHP has been installed and that it is working with Apache 2, I created a PHP file in the web document root. 

```
cd /var/www/html/
sudo nano info.php
```
and then added the following:
```
<?php
phpinfo();
?>
```

Using Firefox, I checked this by visiting `http://MyExternaIP/info.php`. 

This page has information about PHP, Apache2, and the server and their configurations. Lots to read through and worthwhile even though most of it is gibberish to me right now.

It exposes detailed server information, so then I removed it with `sudo rm info.php`. 
 
## Basic Configurations
By default, Apache2 looks for a file called index.html, which acts as the home page/default page. `http://example.com` is actually `http://example.com/index.html` even if the last part isn't shown. 

I changed this default from `index.html` to `index.php`:
```
cd /etc/apache2/mods-enables
sudo cp dir.conf dir.conf.bak
sudo nano dir.conf
```
_Need to use sudo to edit files outside of the ~home directory_

I made a backup file of the original configuration file, and edited the new `dir.conf` to have `index.php` first in line as the default file Apache will search for to display:
```
DirectoryIndex index.php index.html index.cgi index.pl index.xhtml index.htm
```
_This is like changing the settings in a browser. I could delete the other file names (non `.php` and `.html` in this setting, but left them in the file._

And then used a __new command__ `apachectl` to test it:
```
apachectl configtest
```
Syntax Ok means it is all good! No typing mistakes that will break the application.

To apply the changes and check the status:
```
sudo systemctl reload apache2
sudo systemctl restart apache2
sudo systemctl status apache2
```
## Create index.php File
In `/var/www/html/` I created a file called `index.php` via `nano`. Since I changed the Apache configuration to look for an `index.php` file first, this will now be the file displayed when I put go to my IP address page.

PHP is processed by the `php` program and Apache, and then converted into HTML (depending on some other conditions). 

Added the textbook supplied Browser & OS Detection HTML/PHP to this file. 

After saving this file, when I reloaded my external IP in the address bar, the Browser & OS Detection was displayed as expected. 

Can visit my `externalIP/index.html` to see that HTML file displayed still, and `externalIP/index.html.original` to see the Apache2 Default Page.

## Takeaways
Fun week! PHP is totally new to me, and I'm excited to see how it works with MySQL to present data-based content. 

I'm more confident with my understanding of how each of these pieces goes together, and how each is configured. Knowing Apache2 is configured with just text files, for example, demystifies the back end. 

Documentation rules! Reading through `man` and `tldr` files is also becoming second nature.

I don't know how much PHP I want to learn at this moment, but it's cool knowing things like `!==` is a Boolean "NOT" operator, and `| |` is a Boolean "OR". 

Also I keep forgetting that I can use`$(date +%F).md` at the end of my log files to automatically put today's date in the file name in yyyy-mm-dd format. Noting here for future reference.
