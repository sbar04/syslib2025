#Searching with GreP

This week we are learning to search with `grep`.
I downloaded a scopus.bib doc for "lego" "child*" and "play"; exported the top 100 results

Piping with a column is definitely helpful. Enjoyed the results of the following command:

```
grep -i "language =" scopus.bib | sort | uniq -c
```

To save the output of a grep output need to do a Bash redirect with a right angle bracket `>`
```
grep "language =" scobus.bib > grep_output.txt
```

To save a `grep` command in a file then execute them from the file:
`nano grep_command.sh`
Open this file and add
```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

grep "search string" file_name > grep_output.txt
```

Then run using `bash grep_command.sh`

## OTHER USEFUL THINGS:
* `ctrl-D` to get back to the commandline
* tab completion makes life easier
* up arrow key goes through previous commands
* created a snapshot of VM today before we start installing programs
* use \ at the end of a command line to continue the command on the next line
        * Example: 
```
grep "year =" scopus.bib |\
awk -F'=' '{ print $2 }' |\
grep --color=NEVER -Eo '[0-9]*' |\
sort |\
awk '$1 >= 2017 { print $1 }'
```
