This week I installed Koha, which is a free and open source Integrated Library System (ILS). An ILS holds information about patrons and library resources, and it has modules for cataloging new materials, circulating materials, and having a patron-facing OPAC.

## New GCloud VM Instance

This installation needs more RAM and space than my current VM can provide, so I needed to create a new one.

In my gcloud project, I clicked **Create instance**.

### Machine Configuration Tab
I named the new instance **koha-main**, and I left the region and zone options at the default.

I kept the series as **E2**, and kept the machine type as **e2-medium (2 vCPU, 1 core, 4 GB memory**.

### OS and Storage Tab
In this tab I changed the settings to the following:

* Operating system: __Ubuntu__
* Version: __Ubuntu 22.04 LTS *x86/64 architecture*__
* Boot disk type: Balanced persistent disk
* Size (GB): __20__

### Data Protection Tab
I opted for **No backups** in this tab. I didn't have this set up for my other machine, and I prefer backing up manually with snapshots.

### Networking Tab
I checked the box next to **Allow HTTP traffic**.
 
In the **Network tags** box, I added the following tag: `koha-8080`.  

This is important for allowing for the staff-side login later. See the **Setting up a Firewall Rule** section below for more information.

  

### Observability Tab
I didn't Install the Ops Agent. I can install this later if needed.  

### Security and Advanced Tabs

I left both of these tabs alone at the default settings.
  

### Setting up a Firewall Rule
To access the staff interface for Koha, I needed to set up a special port for HTTP data on port 8080.

When I allowed HTTP traffic on this machine, it instructed the console firewall to allow traffic through port 80, which is the default port for HTTP and where the patron-facing side of Koha will be seen.

To allow web traffic through port 8080, I set up a new firewall rule.

In the Google Cloud Console, I went to the menu in the top left corner and clicked **View All Products**.

Using the menu on the side, I went to **Networking** and clicked on **VPC Network**.

On the lefthand side, I clicked on **Firewall**. At the top, I clicked **Create firewall rule** (NOT policy).

I named this rule **koha-opac**, and added the following description: **Open port 8080 for the OPAC**.

Under **Targets**, I kept the dropdown as **Specified target tags**. In the **Target tags** box I added `koha-8080`.

Under **Source filter**, I kept the dropdown as **IPv4 ranges**, and I added **0.0.0.0/0** to allow traffic from all IP addresses.


Under **Protocols and ports**, I kept the setting as **Specified protocols and ports**. I checked the box next to **TCP**, and in the **Ports** box, I added **8080**.

Then, **Create**.

## Installing Koha Repo

First, I prepped my server for the installation by running my usual maintenance commands:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt autoremove
sudo apt clean
```
I then had to install a few prerequisites:

```
sudo apt install gnupg2 apt-transport-https
```
I didn't get a notice that a new Linux kernel had been downloaded, but if I had, I would need to run:

I did get a notice that the kernel updated, so I also ran

```
sudo reboot now
```

### Add Koha repository

In order for my `sudo apt update` command to update Koha once it's installed, I need to tell my machine to check a remote repository for updates that it doesn't normally check.

I need to add this repository to for `apt update` to sync with it.

Most of the commands I need require administrator access, so I logged into the shell as the root user:

```
sudo su
```

*I actually didn't do this on my first go-through and it sucked. I highly recommend just doing this part, rather than using `sudo` before every command.*

Add the Koha repository to the server:

```
echo 'deb http://debian.koha-community.org/koha stable main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/koha.list
```

Download and install the GPG key in the `trusted.gpg.d.` directory:

```
wget -qO- https://debian.koha-community.org/koha/gpg.asc | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/koha.gpg > /dev/null
```

* `wget` allows me to get content from web servers, rather than the more narrow `apt` options.
* GPG or Gnu Privacy Guard has to do with encryption.
* Piping this through `tee` puts this in the correct directory

To double check the key, I ran:

```
gpg --show-keys /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/koha.gpg
```

This output included an email address from `koha-community.org`, which means I can trust it.

### Install Koha
To update/sync the new repository with the Koha remote repository, I can run the following command:

```
apt update
```

I looked for the package information for Koha:

```
apt show koha-common
```

And then installed it after confirming that is the one I want:

```
apt install koha-common
```

### Configuring Koha

The default configuration file for Koha is `koha-sites.conf`. Before making changes, I made a backup of this file:
```
cd /etc/koha
cp koha-sites.conf koha-sites.conf.backup
```

And then I opened it to edit:
```
nano koha-sites.conf
```

I changed the Intraport information from:
```
INTRAPORT="80"
```

To:
```
INTRAPORT="8080"
```

This makes it so my staff interface will appear when I specify to use port 8080 in the URL.

#### MySQL Setup
Just like the other configurations, I also needed to install and setup `mysql-server` in order to make the necessary database for my Koha ILS.

First, I installed `mysql-server`, which also installs Apache2 as a prerequisite:
```
apt install mysql-server
```

Then I set a password for my root MySQL server. I didn't do this on the other VM instance.
```
mysql admin -u root password XXXXXXX
```

Then I enabled URL rewriting and Common Gateway Interference (CGI) functionality:
```
a2enmod rewrite
a2enmod cgi
```

And then restarted Apache2:
```
systemctl restart apache2
```

Then, I created a database for Koha, but NOT through MySQL like in other installations:
```
koha-create --create-db bibliolib
```

Then, I edited the `ports.conf` file for Apache2 to listen on port 8080:
```
nano /etc/apache2/ports.conf
```

Under the line that says `Listen 80`, I added:
```
Listen 8080
```

To check these changes, I ran:
```
apachectl configtest
```

I got **Syntax OK**, so all is well.

Then I restarted Apache2:
```
systemctl restart apache2
```

I disabled the default Apache2 setup:
```
a2dissite 000-default
```

Enabled traffic compression:
```
a2enmod deflate
```

Enabled the **bibliolib** site:
```
a2ensite bibliolib
```

Then reload Apache2's configurations and restarted:
```
systemctl reload apache2
systemctl restart apache2
```

#### Koha Web Installer

From here, I can do everything through the web installer.

To log into the web installer, I need the Koha username and password from a file:

```
nano /etc/koha/sites/bibliolib/koha-conf.xml
```

The `<config>` stanza includes the username and password information. This stanza started at line 252 for me. Save the `<user>` and `<pass>` information to use for the web installer.

Visit the web installer at:

```
http://IP-ADDRESS:8080
```

The [web installer documentation](https://koha-community.org/manual//22.11/en/html/installation.html) was incredibly helpful when walking through these steps.

I added a lot of optional features in the MARC 21 Setup, including:

* Some basic default authorised values for library locations, item lost location, etc.

* Sample patron types and categories

* Sample libraries

* Sample patrons

* Allow access to the following servers to search and download info...

Adding in sample libraries meant I didn't have to create a library in the onboarding tool, but I was easily able to edit these later.

At the end of the installer, I created my Koha administrator information which is the information I use to log into the 8080 staff interface.

### Public OPAC

After finishing the setup, I logged into Koha with those new admin credentials.

I went to the menu dropdown > More > Administration > System Preferences > OPAC > `OPACBaseURL` line

In this line, I added my koha-main server's IP address: `http://IP-ADDRESS`.

And clicked on **Save all OPAC Preferences**.

## Playing Around
I was easily able to figure out how to add patrons and libraries. I added some new loan rules as well.

I ended up batch moving books from some default locations to new libraries that I made.

I haven't been able to figure out how to stage MARC records for import. I get stuck after uploading the file and starting the import job. The status always says `0/null`.

However, it's been fun and easy to add records from a SRU/Z39.50 search.

I actually feel pretty comfortable in the ILS. This is where most of my library experience has been focused, so it's fun to play around in here.

I'm aiming to add some visual updates through the administration settings, but I'm also a little nervous about it given the fact that my WordPress server went down after I added themes and plugins.
