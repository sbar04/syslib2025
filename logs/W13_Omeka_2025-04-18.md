# Week 13: Omeka Installation 

This week, I installed [Omeka Classic](https://omeka.org/), a free and open-source content management system for online digital collections. 

I will link this digital library to my WordPress library homepage. 

This installation was very similar to the WordPress installation. 

### Step 1: Check System Requirements

Before starting, I updated my system:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt autoremove
sudo apt clean
```
I checked the Omeka's documentation for the [system requirements](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Installation/System_Requirements/):

-   Linux operating system
-   [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) version 5.0 or greater
-   [PHP](http://www.php.net/) scripting language version 5.6 or higher (with mysqli and exif extensions installed)
-   [Apache](http://www.apache.org/) HTTP server (with `mod_rewrite` enabled)
-   [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) image manipulation software (for resizing images).

I am working on my Ubuntu server. I have PHP 8.1.2, and MySQL 8.0.41, both of which meet the requirements. 

I read through the [ImageMagick homepage](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) and downloaded it:
```
sudo apt install imagemagick
```

I enabled `mod_rewrite` for Apache2:
```
sudo a2enmod rewrite
```
and restarted Apache2:
```
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

### Step 2: Create a Database and User for Omeka
Like in Week 8, 9, and 12, I created a new database and user for that database in MySQL. 

First I switched to the Linux root user:
```
sudo su
```
And logged into MySQL as the root user:
```
mysql -u root
```
In the MySQL command prompt, I created a new 'omekauser' user and gave the account a password (not Xs):
```
create user 'omekauser'@'localhost' identified by 'XXXXXXXXX';
```
I created an `omeka` database:
```
create database omeka;
```
I granted all privileges to the `omekauser` user on this new database:
```
grant all privileges on omeka.* to 'omekauser'@'localhost';
```
Checked to make sure the database was created:
```
show databases;
```
And exited:
```
\q
```

I also `exit`ed out of the root user in my shell back to my normal user account.

I double checked that this all worked by signing into MySQL as the `omekauser`:
```
mysql -u omekauser -p
```
I logged in with the password I created, and successfully could see the `omeka` database as this user. 


### Step 3: Download Omeka

I first changed to my Apache2 document root directory:
```
cd /var/www/html
```
To get the Omeka download, I went to [omeka.org](https://omeka.org/) and clicked "Download v3.1.2" in the Omeka Classic section. On that page, I copied the link from the "Get Omeka Classic v3.1.2" button.  

Back in my Ubuntu server, in the root directory, I used the `wget` network downloader to download the software from that link:
```
sudo wget https://github.com/omeka/Omeka/releases/download/v3.1.2/omeka-3.1.2.zip
```

And then unzipped this file:
```
sudo unzip omeka-3.1.2.zip
```
This creates a new directory where the full pathway is `/var/www/html/omeka-v3.1.2`. 

I don't want my patrons to have to navigate to a link that ends in `omeka-v3.1.2` to see the Digital Library, so I renamed the directory `DigitalLibrary`:
```
sudo mv /var/www/html/omeka-3.1.2 /var/www/html/DigitalLibrary
```
I also looked at the files that came in this directory, and `cat` to read the README.md file. This had some helpful information including where to read the release notes. 

### Step 4: Configuration
I needed to save my user's login information to the appropriate configuration file. 

For Omeka, this is the `db.ini` file. 

In `/var/www/html/DigitalLibrary`, I made a copy of this file just to make sure I have a clean copy if needed in the future:
```
sudo cp db.ini db-sample.ini
```
I edited the `db.ini` file in `nano`:
```
sudo nano db.in
```
*I actually forgot to use `sudo` the first time and was unable to save the file.*

In this file, there is a link to the Omeka [documentation site](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/). I found the [Database Configuration File](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Technical/DatabaseConfigurationFile/) page using the side navigation. 

I changed the information in the `host`, `username`, `password`, and `dbname` fields. For example, I changed:
```
host     = "XXXXXXX"
```
to 
```
host     = "localhost"
```
Unlike other configuration files I have added user information to, this one requires the `host` information as well. This is simply `localhost` for my database. 

### Step 5: Change File Ownership
To make sure that the Apache2 user, `www-data` can use the files in my Omeka `DigitalLibrary` directory, I needed to transfer ownership to this user.
```
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/DigitalLibrary
```
This changes the ownership and group ownership of this directory AND it's contents (`-R` for recursive) to the `www-data` user. I checked this using the `ls -l` command. I also changed to this directory`cd DigitalLibrary` and saw with `ll`* that all the files were owned and group owned by `www-data`. 
_*I like the `ll` command as a shortcut for `ls -l`_

After making these configuration and ownership changes, I restarted Apache2 and MySQL. 
```
sudo systemctl restart apache2
sudo systemctl restart mysql
```
I checked the status of Apache2, and it was Active and Running. 
```
systemctl status apache2
```

### Step 6: Run the Install Script
In a browser, I went to my new webpage:
```
http://11.111.111.11/DigitalLibrary/
```
From here, I followed the installation steps on the Welcome screen. I set up my site name and my admin username and password for this website. I didn't add any extra information like a description, but I can add this later in my admin page in the settings. 

I read through parts of the [Omeka Classic User Manual](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/), including the introduction video and information about plug-ins and themes. 

I feel pretty confident about installing themes. I explored the `/DigitalLibrary/themes` directory to see what I would be installing if I choose to download a different theme. 

I think I would just go into that directory, use `wget` to download the `.zip` file, and `unzip` that file before going back into the GUI environment to change settings.

It was interesting looking through the files that make up a theme. I saw `.php` , `.js`, `.json`, and `.css` files which is no surprise.
